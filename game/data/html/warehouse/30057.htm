It looks like you're about to head out on a journey. You're not actually going to take all that stuff with you, are you? Listen, let me give you a piece of advice... Leave only with what is absolutely necessary. If you have something to deliver to others, leave it to me. The "Iron Gate" guild will keep your stuff surely and safely, until the person you designated comes.<br>
