<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Marty:<br>
If you feel unsafe about delivering your freight, why don't you leave them with us? We Dwarves manage almost all the warehouse and bank business on the continent. We even have a branch inside the Ivory Tower where no royal family treats us without respect, don't you think we are trustworthy?<br>
