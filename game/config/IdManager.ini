# Enables database cleanup during server startup to remove obsolete or invalid data.
# A larger database may result in a slower startup if cleanup is enabled.
# To speed up startup, set this to 'False'; however, regular cleanup is recommended for optimal performance.
# Default: True
DatabaseCleanUp = True

# Specifies the starting object ID in the range of allocatable IDs.
# This value, along with LastObjectId, defines the entire range of unique IDs that can be allocated.
# Note: FirstObjectId should be less than LastObjectId.
# Default: 268,435,456 (0x10000000)
FirstObjectId = 268435456

# Specifies the ending object ID in the range of allocatable IDs.
# The maximum value (2,147,483,647 or 0x7FFFFFFF) ensures the ID range fits within standard 32-bit integer limits.
# Default: 2,147,483,647 (0x7FFFFFFF)
LastObjectId = 2147483647

# Defines the initial capacity of the BitSet in terms of ID count.
# This setting specifies how many IDs the BitSet can initially track and may influence memory usage.
# Default: 100000
InitialCapacity = 100000

# Sets the utilization threshold for triggering dynamic resizing of the BitSet.
# When the percentage of used IDs meets or exceeds this value, the BitSet expands to accommodate more IDs.
# The value must be between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.9 represents 90% usage).
# Default: 0.9
ResizeThreshold = 0.9

# Sets the growth factor for resizing the BitSet when utilization reaches the ResizeThreshold.
# This multiplier determines how much the BitSet expands, as a factor of its current size.
# For example, a value of 1.1 expands the BitSet by 10% each time resizing occurs.
# Default: 1.1
ResizeMultiplier = 1.1
